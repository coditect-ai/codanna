# JavaScript Parser Coverage Report

*Generated: 2026-01-05 15:18:21 UTC*

## Summary

- Key nodes: 16/16 (100%)
- Symbol kinds extracted: 6

> **Note:** Key nodes are symbol-producing constructs (classes, functions, imports).

## Coverage Table

| Node Type | ID | Status |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| class_declaration | 198 | ✅ implemented |
| function_declaration | 201 | ✅ implemented |
| method_definition | 236 | ✅ implemented |
| field_definition | 231 | ✅ implemented |
| variable_declaration | 151 | ✅ implemented |
| lexical_declaration | 152 | ✅ implemented |
| arrow_function | 204 | ✅ implemented |
| function_expression | 200 | ✅ implemented |
| generator_function_declaration | 203 | ✅ implemented |
| import_statement | 142 | ✅ implemented |
| export_statement | 135 | ✅ implemented |
| namespace_import | 145 | ✅ implemented |
| named_imports | 146 | ✅ implemented |
| rest_pattern | 235 | ✅ implemented |
| jsx_element | 188 | ✅ implemented |
| jsx_self_closing_element | 194 | ✅ implemented |

## Legend

- ✅ **implemented**: Node type is recognized and handled by the parser
- ⚠️ **gap**: Node type exists in the grammar but not handled by parser (needs implementation)
- ❌ **not found**: Node type not present in the example file (may need better examples)

## Recommended Actions

✨ **Excellent coverage!** All key nodes are implemented.
